- We're a **remote** company, we prefer asynchronous communication over meetings.

## About the company

MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
We have gained a large following, thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details, on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by carefully improving the DX.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](https://mui.com/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/), the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host [Templates](https://mui.com/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2x per year) and we have more to come.
We are building [a low-code platform](https://mui.com/toolpad/) for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI's libraries.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](https://mui.com/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

We are aiming to make high-end design accessible to the many, empowering developers that lack access to a designer as well as saving time for designers with a source they can trust.
[According to our last survey](https://mui.com/blog/2021-developer-survey-results/#what-are-your-most-important-criteria-for-choosing-a-ui-library), the quality of the design execution (UX & UI) is the most important criteria used by developers & designers to pick their next UI library.

### Why this is interesting

The advanced components portfolio is still small, with a million interesting and challenging problems to solve.

Our products empower React developers to build awesome applications faster â€“ we see millions of developers on MUI's docs every year, one million a month.

But while we are [the leading](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/#over-the-past-year-which-of-the-following-design-systems-was-your-favorite-go-to-solution) UI design system in the frontend space, the adoption of MUI is only at 25%. More importantly, the challenges of developers and designers to solve when creating UIs go way beyond the ones of design systems.
We envision a future where MUI X becomes the default toolkit for web developers to create advanced UIs.
It's why we started Base UI, Joy UI, and MUI Toolpad. Design is key to achieving this goal.

## About the role

### What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

You will extend the [Design Engineer](https://mui-org.notion.site/Design-Engineer-09e4cac2e0bb4df3b173458b4b4b5666) responsibilities. Depending on the day, you'll:

- **Contribute to deep, meaningful refactors and feature releases**.
  MUI X is a complex codebase. Components we've shipped recently, such as the data grid and date pickers have required months of dedicated, careful work.
- **Reduce friction**.
  A large amount of the work on MUI is reducing friction and making it easier to use.
  This might involve careful API design, identifying and fixing top bugs, creating easier-to-understand error messages, and writing documentation and blog posts about features you ship.
- **Collaborate with the community**.
  Many small, as well as meaningful fixes and features, have been contributed by the community. Your role is to draw the best out of the community â€” to inspire those across the world to create and contribute through your reviews of their issues and pull requests.
- **Experiment and play**. Great, unexpected features and heisenbug fixes have come from a number of sources â€” relentlessly methodical processes of elimination, free-flowing team collaboration, inspiration by adjacent libraries and projects, and difficult-to-explain individual strokes of brilliance. Whatever your preferred style is for creating new things that others might not have thought of, you'll find a welcome home on the team.
- **Take ownership of features from idea/mockup to live deployment**.
  You'll shape and guide the direction of crucial new features, including new components.
- **Ship. Early and often**. You'll iterate and ship frequently.
  You'll have a real impact on the end-user experience and you'll love working on a team that builds stunning UIs and prioritizes delivering real user value as often as possible.
- **You'll be interacting with the users** on a regular basis, handling inbound support and feature requests (every developer helps with developer requests).

### The best parts of this job

- **You'll be at the cutting edge of application development** â€” working on one of the fastest-growing UI libraries on the market.
- **You'll be part of an active, open, friendly community** of developers that are excited about building awesome applications.
- **Your role will be key to making MUI the go-to UI framework** for building applications, websites, and design systems with React.

### The worst parts of this job

- **Shifting context.**
  You will necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done.
  It may even be in an area of the codebase you're unfamiliar with or don't have a ton of understanding about.
  It's fun, rewarding work, but it can be very challenging.
- **We move quickly but don't sacrifice quality**.
  We ship early, often, and quickly. You may not be initially comfortable with the cadence with which we ship high-quality features and improvements to end-users. By doing so, we sacrifice on solving each problem 100% in exchange for fast feedback. Solving 50-70% of the issue with quality should be enough for any given iteration. Our users quickly tell us when we haven't pushed a solution far enough.
- **MUI is a large codebase**. You may bang your head against the wall at times, and then write tests to assist future you ðŸ˜Œ.
  The work you will be doing is somewhat unique and idiosyncratic. You probably have not had a similar role before.
- **In open-source, you're faced with a nonstop stream of bug reports and support requests**. That means you need to develop an intuition for when to ignore something, and when to dig in further.

## About you

### Skills you should have

- 3+ years of relevant web front-end development experience at a tech-forward, product-driven company.
- Advanced knowledge of modern React, HTML, and CSS.
- Experience designing and building public facing-sites that work elegantly.
- A good understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion.

## Benefits & Compensation

Competitive compensation depending on the profile and location.
We are ready to pay top market rates for a person that can clearly exceed the role's expectations.
